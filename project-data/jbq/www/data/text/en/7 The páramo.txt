The páramo is our biggest water reservoir. 
The páramo forest can be compared to sponge. It collects and store the rain water, the water which condensates from the fog and the water from the glaciers. 
What does the páramo do for us? 
Every time we open our tab water or use our electricity we are using the natural benefits of this ecosystem. 90% of drinking water of all the small villages and the big cities comes from the páramo. 
Furthermore it provides the main supply of water for agricultural irrigation in the andine valleys. But there is more. Many hydroelectric power plants are fueled with its water. 
So the páramo is a ecosystem often considered unimportant and unrecognized. BUT it actually provides us with our most important resource: WATER

Did you know that there can be stored more water in the soil than in rivers and ponds?
Its porous soil and its innumerous cavities allow the páramo forest to store immense amounts of water outside of his rivers and ponds. The solid vegetation protects this soil like a carpet but doesn’t compact it because of its light weight. Aditionally the plants don’t absorb all the water. In contrary, they only need little water to survive.
Like this the soil and the vegetation work together as a team. They withhold and release water bit by bit to make sure the rivers, canals, and ponds don’t  overgrow which could cause eruptions, landslides, floods or droughts.
We must protect the vegetation in the páramo! It surrounds our cities! It is more important than we think!
