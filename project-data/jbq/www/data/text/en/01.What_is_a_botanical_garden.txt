What is a botanical garden?
A long time ago Botanical gardens were called “Hortus Medicus” which is Latin for Garden of Medicine. Plants with healing effects from all over the world were growing in these gardens. Today however they fulfill new roles. The plants are collected and demonstrated with the goal of scientific research, protecting species in danger of extinction, demonstrating the biological diversity of a region or country and of course to create a space of  Recovery and Discovery. 
The botanical garden of Quito has made it his task to demonstrate and conserve the variety of plants in the Andean region.
