The sound of the plants
If we imagine that all the plants can work as a huge and beautiful instrument guess who would be their virtuous player.

None other than the wind. With its light touch, it flows above and under the forests vibrant leaves and its wildlife creating a beautiful and big orchestra of green instruments. 
The other virtuous player would be the humans, who have since millennia crafted instruments from all kinds of different plants. Tambours are made out of drained trunks, flutes out of bamboo and out the finest woods guitars, violins and pianos. 
Listen to the sound of the plants!
