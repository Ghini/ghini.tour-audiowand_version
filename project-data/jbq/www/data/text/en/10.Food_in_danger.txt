Food in danger!
Since the colonization important natural products of the Andean farm have been forgotten or devalued. Today's progress, which favors monocultures also reinforces this problem. 
Plants like the mashua, jicama or the oca have been long forgotten. Even by the Ecuadorian people even though they are very healthy. 
The mashua, for example, is good for your prostate. The jicama contains sugar without glucose, which makes it perfect for diabetes patients. The white carrot is easy to digest and therefore perfect for newborns. And all of the plants are natural and much cheaper than processed food or supplements. 
It's time to regain the memory of the Andean farms!
