The Andean Forests: one of the most diverse ecosystems on our planet
The Ecuadorian Andes, which peak at more than 6.000 meters at the Chimborazo, can be described like a immense ladder of living beings. Each step habitats different forms of live. 
Especially the amount of different plants. birds and amphibians which have evolved in the tropical mountain forests, like the Cloud Forest, is enormous. 
Hummingbirds, blackbirds, the güirachuros, turtledoves and sparrows can be found here. In the nights the frogs become active and transform the forest into a concert hall. 
Before turning into a crowded and loud city, Quito should have been a big Andean forest as well. The parque Carolina where we are right now was a lagoon full of wildlife. 

The Andes are only a part of the diversity in Ecuador
Right now we find ourselves in the Andean Cloud Forest, where huge ferns grow next to crooked trees, which are covered in more plants growing on them.
But we are also getting closer to the páramo the higher we go. Between 3200 and 4800 meters we can still find lush and rich flora and fauna. But unfortunately the Cloud Forest and páramo are in danger, in the light of poorly planned and managed development. These ecosystems should be conserved for the better of our society.
