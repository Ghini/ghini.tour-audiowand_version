She is the daughter of Mother Earth (Pacha Mama) who made life possible for humans in an act of generosity. The farm forms the livelihood in the Andes. She provides Medicine, Food, and offerings for the gods. She ensures the continued existence of the Andean people. However, she also demands daily work and also harmony between the people who work with her.
