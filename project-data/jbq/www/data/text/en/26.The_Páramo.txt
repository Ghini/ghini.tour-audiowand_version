26.The Páramo: an ecosystem without trees? As the first Spanish conquistadores arrived at the Andes they saw a kind of vegetation that reminded them of their home: the páramos of Castilla. This name stayed and the other names got lost with time. In Peru the term “jalca” has persisted. Eventhough the páramo is an ecosystem with very few trees, in some areas trees form little forests. The Polylepis, a genus of the rose family, has adapted perfectly to the harsh conditions in the high-andes. Only a few species are found growing near other trees in humid areas. The polylepis forms an important shelter for plants and animals in the astounding height of 4000 to 4850 meters. The small groups they species likes to form are a perfect protection against erosions. Especially fascinating is this trees bark. The tree is also known under the name of “árbol de papel” (tree of paper), referring to the shredding, multi-layered bark that is common to all species of the genus and which protects the tree against low temperatures. This bark is also used as Christmas decoration and decoration for Holy Communion cakes. But the polylepis is not alone in the páramo. Many other especies gather around the polylepis: Pumamaquis, quishuares, chachacomos, arrayanas, laureles de cera and sachacapulies. Unfortunately many Andean forests are in great danger of rapid deforestation and overuse (for example as firewood or construction material).
