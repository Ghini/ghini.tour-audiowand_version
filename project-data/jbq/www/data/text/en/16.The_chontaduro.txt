the chontaduro: the bountiful palm tree

The chontaduro played an incredibly important role in the indigenous communities. 
Clara Inés Olaya described it in her book "Frutas de Ámerica" (Fruits of America) like this: 
"For the indigenous communities from the rainforest (...) the Chontaduro, or pejibaye, was their food, their beverage, their housing; it was their crib and their hammocks, their calendar to celebrate the life and love, it was their weapons to defend themselves from enemies and it was the comforting company in the world of the dead". 
 
And really, the whole tree could be used. From the leaves which formed the roofs of the houses which were built with its wood to the fruits which contain more protein than bananas and avocados together to the spines which could be used as hooks for fishing. 

For the inhabitants of the Ecuadorian part of the  Andean mountain range and the forests, the fruit of the chontaduro is one of the most valuable presents of nature. The harvest is a big celebration.
