“air plants”
Epiphytes adapted through thousands of years of evolution to be able to live on other plants. Without direct access to water or nutrients through the soil they had to invent surprising ways to survive. 
The bromeliads you can see in front of you appear in the form of cones and are designed to store rainwater and nutrients in their shape. Tiny hairs on the base of the leaves then absorb water and nutrients to feed the plant.
The roots of bromeliads that don’t grow on soil also serve to hold onto whatever they are growing on. It is in this context important to note that these plants don’t have a bad influence on the other plants. In contrary to parasites epiphytes actually help the host plant by creating a cooler and moister environment, potentially greatly reducing water loss through transpiration.
Of course bromeliads also root into the earth like for example the achupalla or the pineapple, the most famous bromeliad. 

Epiphytes are small restaurants of the jungle!
These types of plants are not only good for their host plant they also give shelter to innumerous animals such as spiders, insects and frogs. Furthermore they are literally a restaurant for hummingbirds which feed themselves on the nectar of their flowers and on their inhabitants.
