29.The Inca's flowerIn ancient times the South American aborigines loved it to decorate their gardens with beautiful flowers like the angel’s trumpets (Brugmansia). It is said that these flowers are the Inca's flowers. It has the power to banish evil spirits, which is why she is until today often found in Ecuadorian households.In the field of natural medicine, the Brugmansia is of high value. Shamans and healers consider her as a “magical plant”, which can give the patient the power to free himself from his sickness. The hummingbird species “pico de espada” is the only species able to drink the flower's nectar. His extraordinarily long and pointy beak makes this possible.
