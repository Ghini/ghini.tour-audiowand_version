The tropical dry forest
In a dry habitat you have to conserve your resources

What is our first instinct when water resources are starting to get low?
We start saving water so that we have some in tougher times. Exactly the same the plants in the numerous dry habitats on our planet do. Cactuses and agaves for example are tremendously good at storing water inside their bodies. They also grow flat and wide grids of roots to be able to absorb as much rainwater as possible. These adaptions are necessary to survive in the arid ecosystems they live in. 

Trees have developed a different strategy. During rainy seasons they have thousands of green leaves, they grow a lot, are pollinated and grow their fruits. When dry season begin they quickly loose their leaves to conserve energy and not loose water trough evaporation. 

Why are some andine valleys dry areas?

The explanation is easy. The valleys are surrounded by tall mountains, which prevent the humid clouds coming from the coast and the rainforest area to reach the valleys. Therefore the rainfall is very rare in these valleys.
