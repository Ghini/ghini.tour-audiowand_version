The palmtree that brought light into the darkness.

The “Palma de Cera” has a thick layer of white wax on his bark, which was used as a fuel for lamps before the invention of electrical light. With this not only houses but whole villages had a source of light. The leaves were, and still are, used to create beautiful structures that are sacrificed on the holiday of “Domingo de Ramos”. Unfortunately there are only a few trees left in the already shrinking natural forests of the Sierra.
