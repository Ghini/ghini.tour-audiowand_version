...and slowly it stopped being ugly

If we would travel through time and reach times where humans didn't exist and try some prehistoric fruits we would probably be very disappointed. Fruits like we know them today would have tasted bitter or even tasteless for us back then. 
The prehistoric human started the selection process by observing which fruits the animals would prefer. Based on this knowledge he would select the most appetizing and learn how to cultivate generation after generation. With the utmost strictness and dedication, he would pick out those plants who produced the best fruits. Over the following millennia, people perfectioned this process, which made us end up with the huge variety of delicious fruits we have today.
So the next time you eat a fruit, any fruit really, just take a second to think about the thousands of years of selection which made this possible!
The tropical climate zones promote the growth of fruits which is why almost 3.000 different species can be found there.
