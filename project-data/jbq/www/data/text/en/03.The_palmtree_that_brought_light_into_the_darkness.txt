The palm tree that brought light into the darkness.
The “Pahlmah deh Cerah”, literally Wax Palm, has a thick layer of white wax on its bark. This wax was used as fuel for lamps before the invention of electrical light, and it has been over exploited, providing light to whole villages, not just private homes. The leaves of the Palma de Cera are still used to create temporary decorations for the holiday of Palm Sunday. Unfortunately there are only a few trees left in the shrinking natural forests of the Sierra.
