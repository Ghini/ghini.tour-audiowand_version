....millions of years ago
For more than two million years our ancestors were hunters and gatherers. They lived as nomads and plants like (seeds, fruits, sprouts, and tubers) made up almost 80% of their food. Proteins made up the remaining 20%. A group of nomads could without a problem not hunt for several days and be fine. But if vegetables and fruits were missing the group was in trouble. 
The "agricultural revolution"
The most amazing prodigy in human history was without a doubt the discovery of agriculture. The prehistoric "agricultural revolution" started circa 10.000 BC. It occurred simultaneously in different places and made most of the existing nomads settlers. 
This revolution happened through the hard work of "antique scientists", which selected the best crop after every harvest. Like this, the culture medium became better and more healthy every year. 

But how did the agriculture accelerate the cultural development?
•    Because growing crops demanded the nomads to become settlers they had time to learn how to craft materials, which was impossible before. 
•    The knowledge and handling of domestic plants defined social characteristics. Farmers could now provide others with a stable income of food. This meant that others focused more on art, sciences, and technology because they didn't need to hunt anymore.
