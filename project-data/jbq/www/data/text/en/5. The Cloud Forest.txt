The Cloud Forest- one the most diverse corners in the World!
Part of many stories, on the slopes of the mountains, through thick fog, raises the mysterious Cloud Forest. 
Were trees have twisted branches and Spanish moss reaches to the ground there you can find the highest variety of different animal- and plant-species in the whole world. 
The fog travels from the coast and from the Amazonia, collides with the mountains and condensates in this forest. For at least half of each day the whole forest is covered in shadowy fog. 
“Orchidtrees” 
The humidity in the Cloud Forest is so high that thousands of plants grow as epiphytes on the branches of trees. Most of those are orchids, which don’t grow roots that root into the soil to absorb water. Instead they can absorb the humidity out of the fog with roots that grow out of the sprout into the air. Because of this they are sometimes called “air plants”. This way more sunlight reaches them with supports their potential endless growth. 
Other plant species that grow this way are bromelie, fern, moss, lichen and fungi.
