33.Ferns taller than trees.A long time ago, dinosaurs weren’t the only impressive living being one might come along. Tree ferns, as big as 20 meters, dominated the primitive forests. Fossils from the Carboniferous period have been found which date back to 360-300 million years ago. The most amazing thing is that these ferns can be found in Ecuador not too far from here. They grow in many humid ecosystems like for example the Cloud Forest, which is only a few car hours from Quito. Only some species of ferns grow trunks, but those who do, called tree ferns, have trunks taller than 20 meters and leaves longer than 4 meters. That is the length of a big car.Eternal growthTree ferns growth incredibly slow, with an average growth of 10 centimeters per year. To take a comparison, the spruce growths about 37 centimeters a year and the oak tree about 40 millimeters a year. Take some time and guess how old the tree ferns in front of you might be!
