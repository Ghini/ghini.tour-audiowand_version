36.The Páramo: much more than dull scrublandThe higher parts of the Andes oft look monotonous and unproductive. Many times people have tried to give the Páramo a new role: sheep and cows have been held there, pines have been planted, potatoes cultivated, often times with negative outcomes.But the Páramo doesn’t need a second role. His first role is already very important. Useful plants grow here. The straw, for example, has been used to build houses and feed animals. Not to forget about the immense Water reserves stored in the Páramos soil, rivers and lakes. El mortiño: the blueberry of the AndesThis tiny, purple or black looking berry grows in the Páramo. She is a member of the Ericaceae. Mostly known as an ingredient of the famous beverage “colada morada” the mortiño has a big resemblance with the in the western world known blueberry. Colada Morada is prepared at 2nd of November, All Souls Day, celebrated in many latino countries. The lesson we learn is: the Páramo is much more interesting and useful as the first look may appear.
