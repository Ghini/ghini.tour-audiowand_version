This orchid gets its name from its pod-like shape. The fruit is harvested while still being green and then the capsules, which contain the vanilla are fermented in a long process until a dark, oily resin is segregated: the vanilla essence. Elixir of the gods.Named “Orchid of vanilla” by some Authors, this orchid originates from Ecuador.
