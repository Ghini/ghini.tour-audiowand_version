35.Plants suited for the cold.The plants living in the P‡ramo have adapted well to the extreme climate in this height: strong winds, temperatures below freezing point at night and extreme sun radiation at day. Plants such as the Espeletia (which has a big resemblance to the sunflower) have numerous ways to fight these conditions.First of all, the succulent leaves are layered with thousands of tiny hairs. The trunk is covered in old leaves isolating him from the cold. The leaves also work as an isolating coat to protect the flower and the seeds. Moreover, the plant can produce a chemical substance to prevent the water inside the plant from freezing, almost like the antifreeze in cars.Battalions of GiantsThe Espeletia can grow in groups of thousands of individual plant, but that only in two places of the world: the forest of Carchi and the legendary national park of Llangantes, where they grow up to 10 Meters in height.
