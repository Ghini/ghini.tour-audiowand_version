Thousands of small leaves form a cushion, only up to three centimeters high to reduce heat loss. Inside the cushion, the heat and moisture is preserved in a mass called humus. It consists mostly of the old dead leaves and rainwater. This hummus works as a reservoir for nutrients. The highly adapted plant grows at altitudes between 3.200 and 4.500 meters. Because it mostly grows in nutritionally poor soils and is very conservative with his resources it only grows about 1,5 centimeters per year. Some yaretas are estimated to be over 3000 years old.
