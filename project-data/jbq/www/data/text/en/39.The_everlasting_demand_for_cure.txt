39.The ever-lasting demand for cure!Since the beginning of mankind individuals all over the world have observed and experimented with herbs, shrubs and trees to find out which ones can help to prevent or cure diseases. The usage of medicine has developed over thousands of years. Knowledge from all over the world, at first handed over orally, later in written form. The results were writings such as the herbalism and phytomedicine. “anonymous heroes”We can, without a doubt, praise countless anonymous individuals, who have voluntarily, sometimes mandated and even accidently “sacrificed” themselves for science through experiments with toxic plants. These experiments have granted us today essential knowledge, which is why these pioneers of science should be called heroes. Back to the rootsAfter the immense Boom of the pharmaceutical industry and with that the misuse and overuse of pills and Co. comes now the tendency of returning to natural medicine. The reason for that is often times the improved treatment options, as well as the higher security for your health. Chemical medicines pose a high risk and can put a strain on the human body. Side effects and antibiotic resistance are problems not to be ignored. Natural medicine can often offer a more sane (considerate) and effective alternative.
