38.The p‡ramo: a huge wetlandTypical wetlands are mangrove forests, the coast, swamps and even artificial lakes. The P‡ramo can easily be included into this list, because it works like a collection basin of the water from the glaciers and rivers, which would flow into the Amazon Basin. Some swamps and lakes in the p‡ramo arose from the growing and shrinking glaciers in the last glacial period 11.000 years ago.Wetlands in general are fundamental for the environment. They store huge amounts of carbon dioxide and help reducing the greenhouse effect. Moreover they produce 24% off all biomass produced by plants through photosynthesis. Wetlands with international importance are protected by the convention of Ramsar. The glacial periods Earth has gone through, depending on the definition, four to seven glacial periods. In these periods the glaciars expanded immensely and covered most part of the P‡ramo. In the warm ages after the glaciars moved back and left-behind a new landscape. Through this the landscape has changed several times over the history of our planet.
