The giant of the Cloud forest. 
The Podocarpus stands out through his height, his giant crown and his evergreen leaves. The biggest ones that have been found here in Ecuador measured about 2 meters in Diameter and more than 30 meters in height. Because of the high value of his wood the tree is in danger of extinction. But at the moment you can still find this tree in the national park of Loja and the Bosque de Mazán in Azuay. 

Cousins of the pine!
The Podocarpus is part of the pine family. Their seeds grow inside of the cones which is a feature they share. The difference lies in the origin of the two trees. The emigration of the pines to Southamerica was manmade. The Pococarpus meanwhile has already been growing on this land.
