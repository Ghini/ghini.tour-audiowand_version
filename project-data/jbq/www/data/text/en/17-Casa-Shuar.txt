Casa Shuar: ethnobotanical sanctuary and relict
Few things summarize the ethnobotany (relation between human being and plants) as well as the typical housing of the Amazon villages. The Casa Shuar, for example, is made out of the chontaduro tree. Slats for the walls are made out the trunk. The roof is made out of the leaves. Inside is the stove. Also made out of the same wood. Here not only food is prepared. Medicine, dyes and gleaned fibers of the farms and forests are produced here. Hammocks and cooking utensils are made out of fibers and wood too. 
Here you also drink the chicha (a fermented or nonfermented drink usually derived from grains, corn or fruits), and celebrate rituals where you drink Natem/Ayahuasca ( a brew made out of vine and other ingredients) to call the spirit of Arutam which lends strength and confidence. 
The Casa Shuar has an elliptic form and is divided into two zones: the "ekent", the family area for women and small children, the "Tankamash", the social part for the men and for visits.
