22.What makes an orchid an orchid?The secret lies within the flower:?     All orchids have three equal sepals and three petals including a fancy one to attract insects for pollination. This one is called labellum or lip.?    The male part (Pantera) and the female part (stigma) of the flower are joined in one single structure, which is called column (column).?   The column is generally located in the opposite direction of the labellum at the center of the flower. It is almost never possible to see the column though. ?   Pollen is gathered in big masses inside bags called pollinium. This is unique among flowers, which makes it the most outstanding feature of the orchids. Comparison of flower structures: orchid and common flower:
