23.Art of seduction. The telipogon orchid imitates the Tachinidae fly with her flower. When the male tachinids mistake the flower with a female tachinid they land a short moment on the flower until the trap is discovered. This short touch is all the plant needs to push all her pollen onto the fly, which will pollinate the next flower with it. Like this the telipogon and many other orchids assure their reproduction.
