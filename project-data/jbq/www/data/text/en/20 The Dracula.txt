The “Dracula”
Her flowers are mainly pollinated by flies who like rotting material, ripe fruits or mushrooms. With its labellum (or lip) in the form of a mushroom, these orchids trick the flies into laying their eggs into the flower. Once the fly lands on the labellum the trick was successful. When the fly flies away it carries the pollen to other flowers.
