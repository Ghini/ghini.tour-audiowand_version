# ghini.tour
audio and geographic tour through a garden

## idea

we want to offer visitors something functionally similar to the audio tours that most musea, at least in Europe, offer.

you see a plate in the garden, grab the guide, type the number shown on the plate, you get to hear an explanation in your language.

## realization

we plan to use rogerhyam/audiowand

## roadmap

audiowand works on android,
android is mostly based on java and audiowand follows the guideline.

in order to just start setting up the development environment, you need to
download such a large amount of data that I never yet managed to find the
time to do it.
