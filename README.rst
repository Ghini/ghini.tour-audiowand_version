ghini.tour
====================

Garden audio guide and geographic tour.

Idea
--------------------

A ghini.tour offers visitors something functionally similar to the audio
guides offered at the entrance of most modern musea.

There is only one ghini.tour; each guide is just a configuration, you
download it from the ghini.tour configuration page, use it during your
visit, you can remove it after you leave the garden.

The guides offer spoken text associated to spots in the garden, a detailed
map of the garden on which you can see your precise position if your phone
has a GPS sensor, and that's about it.

configuring and installing
-------------------------------

Garden administrators willing to provide a ghini.tour of their garden, need
to:

* make sure that openstreetmap precisely and accurately describes your
  garden,
* write an introduction text for your garden,
* provide a set of points of interest (POIs) for your garden, each with its
  own text description, in as many languages as you think appropriate,
* apart from the openstreetmap edits, send the data to me, so I can include
  it in our data repository.
  
Garden visitors only need to:

* install ghini.tour from google play,
* start ghini.tour,
* select and download the garden among the available tours,

Although all through the documentation we talk about gardens and botany, the
guides you can produce with ghini.tour are not at all limited to botanic
gardens.

keeping track of tours
----------------------------

we haven't decided yet, but I wish to

* have tour texts on weblate, with one configuration marked as the "source"
  and then translations to whatever other languages we desire,
* let ghini.tour download texts and audio from ghini.me,
* ghini.me would be producing the audio files automatically,
